        For the past two years, I have self-taught, been skilled and
        self-motivated to become knowledgeable in the user interface, testing,
        and debugging processes. I have proactively equipped with a diverse and
        promising skill-set in designing, installing, testing and maintaining
        web systems. I am able to effectively self-manage independent projects
        and collaboratively work in a team setting. I am proficient in an
        assortment of technologies and would like to become a senior web
        developer and a professional in my chosen practice field.
